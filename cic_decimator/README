Purpose: The purpose of this module is to decimate by 313 (using
a compensated CIC filter structure). The corresponding system
has a passband that is in the -0.25 to 0.25 of the Nyquist
bandwidth at the slower sampling rate (-0.25/313 to 0.25/313 for
the faster sampling rate). The passband rippler is guaranteed
(see associated tests) to be less than 0.5 dB.
