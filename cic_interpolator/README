Purpose: The purpose of this module is to interpolate by 313 (using
a compensated CIC filter structure). The corresponding system
has a passband that corresponds to -0.225 to 0.225 of the Nyquist
bandwidth at the slower sampling rate (or -0.225/313 to 0.225/313
at the faster sampling rate). The passband ripple is guaranteed
(see associated tests) to be less than 0.5 dB.
