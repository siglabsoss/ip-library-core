
The modules in this folder are intended to work with the Lattice Semiconductor Gigabit Ethernet MAC IP.
They provide support for using the Lattice Gbit MAC IP such as forming UDP packets for transmission,
routing incoming Ethernet II Frames to various queues based on their EtherType field, arbitrating access to
the Gbit MAC IP to support multiple Tx streams all using the one Ethernet connection, etc.

Please see each module for more detail regarding its intended use and functionality.
