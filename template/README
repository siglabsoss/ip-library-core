Purpose: The purpose of this module is to provide a template to
demonstrate how the IP directory structure might be applied. It
demonstrates the bare minimum requirements for publishing IP to
this repository. It meets all requirements except the synthesis
requirement. This module is called a_module, but the directory
is called template to distinguish it as a template and ease the
creation of the directory structure for new modules. For actual
IP, the root directory name should be altered to reflect the
name of the IP.
