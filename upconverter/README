Digital Upconverter
---------------------

Overview: This block converts a signal at baseband to a -39 MHz IF and
then outputs the real part (resulting in a real signal centered at 39 MHz).
It includes two halfband interpolation filters for a total upsampling by
4. If the input rate is 31.25 MS/s, the output rate is 125 MS/s. The output
The input is a a quadrature signal while the output is real-valued.

This iteration of the upconverter consists of the halfband filters,
multipliers to bring the input samples to IF, and a table look-up for
the sine/cosine values needed.

Input Signaling Ports:

========================+=========+======================================
Name                    | Width   | Description
========================+=========+======================================
i_inph_data             | 16-bits | In-phase baseband sample
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
i_quad_data             | 16-bits | Quadrature baseband sample
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
o_ready                 |  1-bit  | Strobe that indicates two samples are
                        |         | ready to be read at the above ports.
                        |         | Samples should always be ready from
                        |         | the upstream block
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
i_clock                 |  1-bit  | Clock signal
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
i_reset                 |  1-bit  | Synchronous reset signal
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------

Output Signaling Ports:

========================+=========+======================================
Name                    | Width   | Description
========================+=========+======================================
o_inph_data             | 16-bits | This is the real part of the
                        |         | downconverted/decimated output
                        |         | signal.
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
o_quad_data             | 16-bits | This is the imaginary part of the
                        |         | downconverted/decimated output
                        |         | signal.
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
i_ready                 | 1-bit   | Strobe signal that indicates that
                        |         | another output is needed by the
                        |         | downstream block. The sample is
                        |         | guaranteed to be ready

Note: This HDL uses inference for a big block RAM that is used as a ROM.
To correctly infer this, the file "duc_sincos.mif" must be added to the
directory where the synthesizer is run. If not, then the block RAM will
not be initialized correctly, and the output will be held at a zero
value.
