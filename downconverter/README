Digital Downconverter
---------------------

Overview: This block converts a signal at a -39 MHz IF to baseband. The
downconverter demodulates the input to recenter the IF frequency at DC,
then the signal goes through 3 halfband FIR filters. Each one decimates
the input by 2, so the output signal is 8x decimated compared to the
input signal. The input is a real-valued signal operating at twice
the clock frequency (two samples are received at a time). If these two
samples come in on every clock cycle, then an output sample is available
every fourth clock cycle.

This iteration of the downconverter consists of a table look-up for the
sine/cosine values needed, multipliers to bring the input samples to
baseband, and the halfband filters.

Input Ports:

========================+=========+======================================
Name                    | Width   | Description
========================+=========+======================================
i_inph_data             | 16-bits | Real-valued ADC sample at time n
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
i_inph_delay_data       | 16-bits | Real-valued ADC sample at time n + 1
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
i_valid                 |  1-bit  | Strobe that indicates two samples are
                        |         | ready at the above ports. If samples
                        |         | are always ready, this can be tied
                        |         | high.
------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------
i_clock                 |  1-bit  | Clock signal
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
i_reset                 |  1-bit  | Synchronous reset signal
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------

Output Ports:

========================+=========+======================================
Name                    | Width   | Description
========================+=========+======================================
o_inph_data             | 16-bits | This is the real part of the
                        |         | downconverted/decimated output
                        |         | signal.
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
o_quad_data             | 16-bits | This is the imaginary part of the
                        |         | downconverted/decimated output
                        |         | signal.
------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------
o_valid                 | 1-bit   | Strobe signal that indicates when an
                        |         | output is available to be read from
                        |         | the two output ports above.

Note: This HDL uses inference for a big block RAM that is used as a ROM.
To correctly infer this, the file "ddc_sincos.mif" must be added to the
directory where the synthesizer is run. If not, then the block RAM will
not be initialized correctly, and the output will be held at a zero
value.
